Every process in an operating system has three standard data streams:

* **Standard Input (`stdin`)**
* **Standard Output (`stdout`)**
* **Standard Error (`stderr`)**

All three are *duplex streams*, meaning they can support both reading and writing.
However, in most practical scenarios:

* `stdin` is used for reading input.
* `stdout` and `stderr` are used for writing output and error messages, respectively.

To fully utilize their duplex nature, we’d need to write custom code that handles both reading and writing.

## Practical Example

Let’s take **bash** as an example:

* When we type a command like `ls`, the **bash process** receives our input through its **readable** `stdin` stream.
* The bash process then writes the command’s output to its **writable** `stdout` stream.
* If we type an invalid command, bash writes the corresponding error message to the **`stderr`** stream.

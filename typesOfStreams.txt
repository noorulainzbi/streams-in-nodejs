Duplex, Transform & PassThrough Streams in Node.js

These are advanced stream types in Node.js used when you need control over both reading and writing data. They are commonly used in networking, compression, encryption, and real-time data processing.

1️⃣ Duplex Stream
What it is

A Duplex stream can read and write data independently.
The readable side and writable side do not depend on each other.

Key point

Writing data does not automatically produce readable output

Read and write are separate channels

Analogy

🗣️ Walkie-talkie — you can speak and listen at the same time, but speaking does not guarantee you’ll hear your own voice.

Use cases

Network sockets (net.Socket)

TCP connections

WebSockets

IPC (process communication)

Import
import { Duplex } from "stream";

2️⃣ Transform Stream (Subclass of Duplex)
What it is

A Transform stream is a special type of Duplex stream where:

Data written to the stream is transformed and then read out

Key point

Read and write are linked

Output is derived from input

Transformation logic lives in the transform() method

Analogy

🌍 Translator — input comes in one language, output comes out in another.

Use cases

Compression / decompression

Encryption / decryption

Parsing or formatting data (CSV → JSON, lowercase → uppercase)

Import
import { Transform } from "stream";

3️⃣ PassThrough Stream (Special Case of Transform)
What it is

A PassThrough stream is a Transform stream that does not modify data.
It simply forwards chunks as-is.

Key point

Input === Output

Still follows Transform stream rules

Read/write are linked, unlike Duplex

Analogy

🧪 Glass tube — whatever enters comes out unchanged.

Use cases

Debugging stream pipelines

Logging data flow

Measuring data size

Monitoring or branching streams

Import
import { PassThrough } from "stream";
